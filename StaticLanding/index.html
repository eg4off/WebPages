                BrainVu uses a non-invasive and remote mobile/AR/VR camera to extract physiological bio-markers that indicate
                changes in brain activities and extract human emotional responses including: Mental Load, Stress Level and Emotional
                Engagement. Using these responses BrainVu can connect to a multitude of platforms and provide emotional and mental
                representation for those responses.

                            BrainVu analyzes a spectrum of unique eye measurements to identify changes in alertness, attention i.e. mental effort. To understand the consumer’s tendency toward a certain subject by reenacting sensory and emotional experiences (such as taste, video and more) BrainVu uses
                            a set of questions and responses measured 
                            by the system.
